        <h1>Redirecting to the Game Server...</h1>
        <p>
            We created this page because the <strong>steam://connect/</strong> link we used to provide is no longer possible
            to make an actual clickable link in browsers. Due to restrictions with how browsers handle Steam protocol links,
            players were unable to directly click the link to join the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page automatically redirects you to the game server, and if that doesnâ€™t work, you can simply click the button below
            to manually connect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for playing ZeroRP! We hope this makes joining our server easier for you.
